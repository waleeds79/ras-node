node-red-node-cf-cloudant
=========================
A pair of [Node-RED](http://nodered.org) nodes to work with documents
in a [Cloudant](http://cloudant.com) database that is integrated with
[IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net).

Install
-------
Install from [npm](http://npmjs.org)
```
npm install node-red-node-cf-cloudant
```

Usage
-----
Allows basic access to a [Cloudant](http://cloudant.com) database to
`insert`, `update`, `delete` and `search` for documents.

To **insert** a new document into the database you have the option to store
the entire `msg` object or just the `msg.payload`. If the input value is not
in JSON format, it will be transformed before being stored.

For **update** and **delete**, you must pass the `_id` and the `_rev`as part
of the input `msg` object.

To **search** for a document you have two options: get a document directly by
its `_id` or use an existing [search index](https://cloudant.com/for-developers/search/)
from the database. For both cases, the query should be passed in the
`msg.payload` input object as a string.

When getting documents by id, the `payload` will be the desired `_id` value.
For `search indexes`, the query should follow the format `indexName:value`.
